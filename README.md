# cs491_template

This is a template repo for PSU CS491/591.

## Setup

The easiest way to use this repo is to click the "Use this template" button above. This will create a new repo in your account with the same files as this one. You can then clone that repo and start working on it.

All homework will be submitted via GitHub. Each assignment will be in a folder within your version of this repo. You will submit your work by pushing your changes to your repo. You can push as many times as you want, but only the last push before the deadline will be graded unless you make a special request.

Each assignment folder has a README.md file in it. You should put anything in this file you need us to know about your submission. Any explanation for something missing, any special instructions we should keep in mind while grading, that sort of thing. If you don't have anything to say, you can just make note of that in the README.
